Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
non-exclusive, perpetual license to exercise the rights in the Work as
stated below:

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
   Adaptations, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
   Adaptations;

b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
   Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
   reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
   that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
   translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
   English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
   work has been modified.";

c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
   incorporated in Adaptations; and

d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

e. For the avoidance of doubt:
   i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
      in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
      compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
      reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
      exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
   ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
       which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
       compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
       the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
       by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
       collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
       the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
       voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any
       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
   terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
   Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
   impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License
   or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights
   granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
   sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
   this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
   the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
   Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
   technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
   recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
   that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
   applies to the Work as incorporated in a Adaptation, but it does
   not apply to the Work itself.

b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)
   the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
   the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
   jurisdiction license (either this or a later version of that license);
   (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the
   Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must
   comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation
   under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or
   (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of
   the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I)
   You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License
   with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
   Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation
   that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of
   the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to
   that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You
   must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License
   and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as
   included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV)
   when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not
   impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
   restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
   exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
   Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
   incorporated in a Collection, but it does not apply to the
   Adaptation itself.

c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
   above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
   commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange
   of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital
   file-sharing or otherwise does not constitute Commercial Use,
   provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection
   with the exchange.

d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
   or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
   Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
   provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
   name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
   and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
   or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal)
   for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
   notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
   such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii)
   to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
   specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
   refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
   and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an
   Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
   Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
   Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
   The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any
   reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
   Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
   credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
   appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
   prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
   the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
   Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
   and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
   implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
   sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
   Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
   without the separate, express prior written permission of the
   Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

e. For the avoidance of doubt:
   i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
      in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
      compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
      reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
      exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
   ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
       which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
       compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
       the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
       by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
       collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
       the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
       voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any
       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

f. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
   otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
   or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
   Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
   or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
   be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
   Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
   any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
   (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
   mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
   the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
   or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
   permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
   reasonably exercise the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
   License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENT OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY
FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF
LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
   Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
   from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
   terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
   compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
   survive any termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
   is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
   Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
   release the Work under different license terms or to stop
   distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
   election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
   license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
   of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
   effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
   Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
   under this License.

   offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
   terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
   of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
   action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
   reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
   and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
   breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
   and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
   modified without the mutual written agreement of Licensor and You.

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
   License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
   for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as updated on
   1971), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this
