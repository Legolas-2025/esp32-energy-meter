A DIY smart energy monitoring system based on ESP32 with ESPHome firmware, featuring real-time power monitoring, OLED display, and Home Assistant integration.

## ⚡ Overview

This project provides a comprehensive energy monitoring solution that measures AC power consumption in real-time. The system displays power, voltage, and current on a local OLED screen while simultaneously sending data to Home Assistant for detailed analytics and automation.

## 📋 ESPHome Compatibility

> **Requires ESPHome 2026.9.0 or newer.**
>
> The current configuration uses the new Modbus sizing model introduced in 2026.9.0 (register count is derived from `value_type`, and `command_throttle` has moved to `turnaround_time` on the `modbus:` hub). Earlier versions of ESPHome will reject the file with a `register_count has been removed` validation error.
>
> To install or upgrade ESPHome:
> ```bash
> pip install --upgrade esphome
> ```
>
> See [`docs/configuration-guide.md`](docs/configuration-guide.md#esphome-202690-migration) for the full migration notes and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed in `2.1.0`.

The original project provided the foundation for this enhanced version, which adds several improvements including:
- Enhanced WiFi connectivity monitoring
- OLED burn-in protection
- Improved display formatting
- Optimized update intervals
- ESPHome 2026.9.0 compatibility (`register_count` / `response_size` removed, `turnaround_time` added)

## 📋 Hardware Requirements

### Main Components
- **ESP32 Wemos D1 Mini** (recommended - compact ESP32 development board)
- **JSY-MK-194G Energy Meter** with Modbus RTU over RS485
- **SSD1306 128x64 OLED Display** (I2C)
- **RS485 to TTL Converter Module** (for Modbus communication)
- **Meanwell APV-8-5 5V 8W Power Supply** (for system power)

### Optional Components
- **3D Printed Enclosure** (see hardware guide)
- **Current Clamps** (for non-invasive monitoring)
- **Voltage Transformers** (if needed for voltage measurement)

### Wiring Requirements
- **UART Pins**: TX (GPIO17), RX (GPIO16)
- **I2C Pins**: SDA (GPIO21), SCL (GPIO22)
- **Power Supply**: 5V external supply to ESP32 +5V pin, ESP32 3.3V powers all peripherals

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Hardware Assembly
Refer to our detailed [Hardware Guide](docs/hardware-setup.md) for complete assembly instructions.

### 2. ESPHome Configuration

1. **Install ESPHome (2026.9.0 or newer)**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade esphome
   esphome version
   ```
   Confirm the reported version is `2026.9.0` or later before continuing.

2. **Configure Secrets**:
   Create a `secrets.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   wifi_ssid: "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
   wifi_password: "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
   ```

3. **Upload Configuration**:
   ```bash
   esphome run esp32-energy-meter.yaml
   ```

### 3. Home Assistant Integration
1. **Auto-Discovery**: ESPHome devices are automatically discovered by Home Assistant
2. **Manual Addition**: If auto-discovery fails, use ESP32's IP address
3. **Energy Dashboard**: Add sensors to your Home Assistant energy configuration

## 📊 Monitored Parameters

### Channel 1 & Channel 2
- **Voltage** (V) - Line voltage measurement
- **Current** (A) - Current flow measurement
- **Power** (W) - Real-time power consumption
- **Energy** (kWh) - Total energy consumption
- **Power Factor** - Power quality indicator
- **Frequency** (Hz) - AC line frequency

### System Monitoring
- **WiFi Signal Strength** (dBm) - Network connectivity quality
- **Connection Status** - Binary connectivity indicator
- **Device Uptime** - System reliability monitoring

## 🔄 Enhanced Features

### OLED Display Features
- **Real-time Power Display**: Large, easy-to-read power readings
