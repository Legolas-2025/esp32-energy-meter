A DIY smart energy monitoring system based on ESP32 with ESPHome firmware, featuring real-time power monitoring, OLED display, and Home Assistant integration.

## ⚡ Overview

This project provides a comprehensive energy monitoring solution that measures AC power consumption in real-time. The system displays power, voltage, and current on a local OLED screen while simultaneously sending data to Home Assistant for detailed analytics and automation.

### Key Features

- **Dual Channel Monitoring**: Monitors two separate electrical circuits
- **Real-time Display**: 128x64 OLED display with WiFi status indicator
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Seamless integration with energy dashboards
- **OLED Burn-in Protection**: Automatic screen clearing to prevent display damage
- **Enhanced WiFi Status**: Accurate connectivity monitoring using signal strength
- **Professional Fonts**: Google Fonts integration for clean, readable display
- **Modbus Communication**: Reliable RS485 communication with JSY energy meters

## 🏗️ Original Project Attribution

This project is based on the excellent work by **Giovanni Aggiustatutto** and his original Instructable:

**Original Project**: [DIY Smart Energy Meter With ESP32 + Home Assistant](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Smart-Energy-Meter-With-ESP32-Home-Assistant/)

The original project provided the foundation for this enhanced version, which adds several improvements including:
- Enhanced WiFi connectivity monitoring
- OLED burn-in protection
- Improved display formatting
- Optimized update intervals

## 📋 Hardware Requirements

### Main Components
- **ESP32 Development Board** (any ESP32 variant)
- **JSY Energy Meter** with Modbus RTU over RS485
- **SSD1306 128x64 OLED Display** (I2C)
- **RS485 to TTL Converter Module** (for Modbus communication)

### Optional Components
- **3D Printed Enclosure** (see hardware guide)
- **Current Clamps** (for non-invasive monitoring)
- **Voltage Transformers** (if needed for voltage measurement)

### Wiring Requirements
- **UART Pins**: TX (GPIO17), RX (GPIO16)
- **I2C Pins**: SDA (GPIO21), SCL (GPIO22)
- **Power Supply**: 3.3V and 5V rails

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1. Hardware Assembly

Refer to our detailed [Hardware Guide](docs/hardware-setup.md) for complete assembly instructions.

### 2. ESPHome Configuration

1. **Install ESPHome**:
   ```bash
   pip install esphome
   ```

2. **Configure Secrets**:
   Create a `secrets.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   wifi_ssid: "YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
   wifi_password: "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
   ```

3. **Upload Configuration**:
   ```bash
   esphome run esp32-energy-meter.yaml
   ```

### 3. Home Assistant Integration

1. **Auto-Discovery**: ESPHome devices are automatically discovered by Home Assistant
2. **Manual Addition**: If auto-discovery fails, use ESP32's IP address
3. **Energy Dashboard**: Add sensors to your Home Assistant energy configuration
